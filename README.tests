== Test Suite Usage ==

Four use cases are supported:

  A.  Quick check.  All test cases are run with just randomized
      settings.  Objective is full functional coverage in short period
      of time to identify bugs in the code.  We use pre-defined seed
      value(s) in order to ensure reproducibility.

  B.  Detailed survey. Several or all test cases are run at a series of
      different setting values, and multiple iterations, using a
      specified seed.  These are intended to generate graphable data for
      analysis, and to cover corner-cases that may not have a relation
      to real-world cases.

  C.  Individual study.  One test is run with specific settings and a
      pre-defined seed to study a specific performance issue.

  D.  Benchmark.  Test cases and settings are selected that more closely
      resemble real-world use cases.  Corner-cases are avoided.  The
      tests are iterated many times to get good performance averages,
      and the seed is randomized.  Objective is for comparing different
      rendering technologies, backends, or algorithms for their impact
      on end user experience.


== Test Case Design Focus ==

1.  Draws lots of shapes of varying sizes and styles.  Goal of this test
    is to test raw basic drawing performance.

2.  Performs masking operations on an existing bitmap.  The type of mask
    can be specified or a random assortment applied.  Goal is exercising
    of mask effects and measuring performance of different mask
    operations.

3.  Draws text at different sizes, angles, lengths, paths, etc.  The
    font used can be specified, or a random set will be used.  Unicode
    characters can be included.  Goal is exercising text drawing
    capabilities and measuring performance of text drawing under various
    conditions.

4.  Draws lots of multi-point lines.  Can vary line width, minimum and
    maximum number of points, dash style, line join, end caps, stroke
    color, etc.  Line segments can either be straight, or curves, or a
    random assortment.

5.  Fills shapes of different geometries.  The test probably should
    allow specifying which type of shape to fill.  Could include options
    for drawing it at varying sizes, orientations, line styles, colors,
    etc.  Maybe also permit applying gradients.  Goal is to exercise
    fill specifically, and spot situations where it may be slow.

6.  Draws shadow under different kinds of shapes.  Goal is to measure
    performance of shadow under different conditions.

7.  Animates a number of shapes that move at constant speeds along
    randomly directed paths.  Can include rotations, color or opacity
    changes, size changes, etc.  Goal is to explore optimizations for
    drawing sequences.
