== Test Case Design Focus ==

1.  Draws lots of shapes of varying sizes and styles.  Goal of this test
    is to test raw basic drawing performance.

2.  Performs masking operations on an existing bitmap.  The type of mask
    can be specified or a random assortment applied.  Goal is exercising
    of mask effects and measuring performance of different mask
    operations.

3.  Draws text at different sizes, angles, lengths, paths, etc.  The
    font used can be specified, or a random set will be used.  Unicode
    characters can be included.  Goal is exercising text drawing
    capabilities and measuring performance of text drawing under various
    conditions.

4.  Draws lots of multi-point lines.  Can vary line width, minimum and
    maximum number of points, dash style, line join, end caps, stroke
    color, etc.  Line segments can either be straight, or curves, or a
    random assortment.

5.  Fills shapes of different geometries.  The test probably should
    allow specifying which type of shape to fill.  Could include options
    for drawing it at varying sizes, orientations, line styles, colors,
    etc.  Maybe also permit applying gradients.  Goal is to exercise
    fill specifically, and spot situations where it may be slow.

6.  Draws shadow under different kinds of shapes.  Goal is to measure
    performance of shadow under different conditions.

7.  Animates a number of shapes that move at constant speeds along
    randomly directed paths.  Can include rotations, color or opacity
    changes, size changes, etc.  Goal is to explore optimizations for
    drawing sequences.
