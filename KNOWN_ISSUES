			   ~= Known Issues =~

* On Ubuntu 12.04 with the -radeon video driver, 'caskbench -t egl'
  won't work due to MSAA being unsupported by mesa.  So run it with
  sample buffers disabled:

  caskbench -t egl --disable-egl-sample-buffers

* Memory corruption errors can occur when using a Debug version of skia
  with a Release version of caskbench, on some platforms.  Stick with
  Debug/Debug for both to be safe.  (Issue #14)

* On some (older?) versions of Skia, building a Debug caskbench against
  a Release build of skia can lead to crashes in SkBitmap::getTexture()
  Stick with Debug/Debug or Release/Release, or update to newer Skia.
  (Issue #14)
