			   ~= Known Issues =~

* On Tizen, 'caskbench -t egl' crashes.  It works only when using MSAA,
  so run it with sample buffers enabled:

  caskbench -t egl --enable-egl-sample-buffers

* On Ubuntu 12.04 with Radeon video card and FOSS driver, MSAA does not
  work: It just crashes when using --enable-egl-sample-buffers.  So
  don't do that.

* The text test case can consume excessive amounts of memory on
  large sized runs, triggering the oom killer.  Use it only on lower

* Memory corruption errors can occur when using a Debug version of skia
  with a Release version of caskbench, on some platforms.  Stick with
  Debug/Debug for both to be safe.  (Issue #14)

* On some (older?) versions of Skia, building a Debug caskbench against
  a Release build of skia can lead to crashes in SkBitmap::getTexture()
  Stick with Debug/Debug or Release/Release, or update to newer Skia.
