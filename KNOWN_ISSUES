			   ~= Known Issues =~

* On Tizen, 'caskbench -t egl' crashes.  It works only when using MSAA,
  so run it with sample buffers enabled:

  caskbench -t egl --enable-egl-sample-buffers

* On Ubuntu 12.04 with Radeon video card and FOSS driver, MSAA does not
  work: It just crashes when using --enable-egl-sample-buffers.  So
  don't do that.

* The text test case can consume excessive amounts of memory on
  large sized runs, triggering the oom killer.  Use it only on lower

* The new animation option is included for experimentation but has not
  been widely tested.  When given large values it can severely affect
  performance of some tests.
