caskbench - The Cairo and SKia Benchmark
========================================

Bryce - can you start make benchmarks to compare cairogles vs. skia?
The benchmarks would cover fill, stroke, paint, mask and test.  Both
with constant constant colors and alpha colors, and image as source and
masks.  For example, one of the benchmark for stroke would be run stroke
with random line width, join style, cap style, and random dash length on
randomly generated circles, rectangles.  The benchmarks would use msaa,
and on PC first and identify which areas of skia can be further
optimized.  Then we will port benchmarks to android and tizen and do
further comparison.

We would like to see where the strength and weakness of cairogles or
skia (please use GL backend for both).

* objectives:
  - Cover fill, stroke, paint, mask, and test
  - Constant colors, alpha colors
  - Image as source and masks
  - Use MSAA and focus on PC first
  - Port benchmarks to tizen and android
* Post to github when ready to be public
