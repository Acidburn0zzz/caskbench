caskbench - The Cairo and SKia Benchmark
========================================

This benchmark is designed to do synthetic performance testing of
the cairo and skia drawing libraries.

Our principle goal is to identify problem areas in either of the drawing
libraries for performance work to be done.  To this end, we enable large
scale randomized testing of a broad range of drawing features, but
document the parameters so that particular problem cases can easily be
run in isolation for performance work.

This test strives for a higher level of complexity than Cairo's micro
performance benchmarks.  Instead of focusing on one discrete
functionality and testing it repeatedly, this suite covers a set of
drawing operations, much like would be done in a real world
application.


== Building ==

Prerequisites include popt and gles3.  To install these on Ubuntu 13.04:

 $ sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev libgles2-mesa-dev

You will also need a GL-enabled version of libcairo installed.  This
isn't packaged for Ubuntu currently, so you'll need to build from
source or find a PPA that provides it.

To build this testsuite, use these commands:

 $ cmake .
 $ make

The build system assumes skia has been unpacked and built in the
directory ~/src/skia/trunk.  You can override this via the SKIA_ROOT
option:

 $ cmake . -DSKIA_ROOT=/your/path/to/skia
 $ make


== Usage ==

Caskbench builds to a single executable which you can run directly:

  $ ./src/caskbench

  cairo-bubbles        64     PASS  64  0.005676  0.006731
  skia-bubbles         64     PASS  64  0.000987  0.001234  81.66%
  cairo-fill           64     PASS  64  0.000789  0.000851

The testing will alternate between cairo and skia versions of each
test.  The second column indicates the test size, the fourth column is
the number of iterations.  If the third column shows anything other than
a pass, something's seriously wrong.  The fifth column is the minimum
run time, and sixth is an average.  The last column calculates the
percent difference that skia is faster than cairo on average.

By default caskbench tests using the image backend, which may or may not
be that interesting.  Different backends can be specified via the -t
parameter, and available backends discovered by running:

  $ ./src/caskbench --list-surfaces

  image
  glx
  egl

The --iterations and --size parameters can be used to increase the
intensity of the testing.

  $ ./src/caskbench -t glx --iterations 100 --size 42

Run it with the '-?' flag to see usage directions with explanations of
all available options.


== Design ==

The benchmark comprises several individual tests, each of which provides
a set of inputs that can be varied to exercise drawing functionality in
different ways.

Random permutation of test case inputs are used in order to increase
coverage to unusual cases.  These inputs are pre-generated, and then
provided to both the cairo and skia implementations of the tests.  In
this way, the graphical output by each library should theoretically
be visually (if not bitwise) identical.  The inputs can control the
number of items drawn, their style, and so forth.

The quantity of different input sets to use is user-specified; more
input sets gives more thorough testing, but will take longer to test.

For each input set, the test suite will run the test for a defined
number of iterations.  This is intended to help even out any variation
due to external factors by increasing the number of iterations.

foreach test:
  generate the range of input sets we're going to test
  foreach input set:
    foreach graphics_lib:
      setup test with inputs
      foreach iteration:
        run test case
      cleanup

== Tests ==

Stroke:  Tests different stroke styles on lines, circles, and
rectangles.

Curves:  Tests drawing curved lines in various ways.
See cairo perf's curve.c, many-curves.c

Fill:  Fills

== Original Request ==

Bryce - can you start make benchmarks to compare cairogles vs. skia?
The benchmarks would cover fill, stroke, paint, mask and test.  Both
with constant constant colors and alpha colors, and image as source and
masks.  For example, one of the benchmark for stroke would be run stroke
with random line width, join style, cap style, and random dash length on
randomly generated circles, rectangles.  The benchmarks would use msaa,
and on PC first and identify which areas of skia can be further
optimized.  Then we will port benchmarks to android and tizen and do
further comparison.

We would like to see where the strength and weakness of cairogles or
skia (please use GL backend for both).

* objectives:
  - Cover fill, stroke, paint, mask, and test
  - Constant colors, alpha colors
  - Image as source and masks
  - Use MSAA and focus on PC first
  - Port benchmarks to tizen and android
* Post to github when ready to be public
