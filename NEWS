0.2 - November 8, 2013
----------------------
This release provides improved Cairo tests and matching Skia tests.
Both are run with a common `caskbench` executable, and results tabulated
to stdout or optionally written to a JSON file.

The Skia cmake integration is still incomplete, in that paths are
hardcoded to my own environment.  These will be cleaned up in future
releases.  The main priority was to get everything running on my own
system.


0.1 - November 1, 2013
----------------------
Initial release.  Cairo tests have been stubbed in, but it's got a long
way to go before it's usable.
